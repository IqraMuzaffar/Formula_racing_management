Overview:
The Formula 1 Championship Management System is a Java application designed to manage and track drivers, teams, races, and statistics in the Formula 1 championship. It allows users to create, delete, modify drivers and teams, record race results, display statistics, and save data for future use.

Features:
Create a New Driver: Users can create a new driver and associate them with a unique team (car manufacturer). The driver's statistics, including points, race positions, and participation, are automatically updated.

Delete a Driver: Users can delete a driver and their associated team from the Formula 1 championship.

Change Driver for a Team: Users can change the driver for an existing constructor team (e.g., replace the driver for the Ferrari team).

Display Driver Statistics: Users can view various statistics for a selected existing driver, including points, race positions, and participation.

Display Championship Table: Users can display the Formula 1 Driver Table, showing all drivers competing in the championship, their teams, and their statistics. The table is sorted in descending order based on points earned in the current season.

Add Completed Race: Users can add a completed race with its date and the positions that all drivers achieved. The system automatically updates the statistics of all participating drivers and the Formula 1 championship table.

Save and Resume: The system allows saving all entered information to a file. Upon restarting the application, users can recover the previous state and continue operations, including entering new information or modifying existing data.


Technologies Used:
Java for the application logic and backend processing.
File handling for data storage and retrieval.
Console-based interface for user interaction.
